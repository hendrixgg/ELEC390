# Tasks
- [x] prioritize tasks: everything with names on it are due by feb 11 âœ… 2025-01-28
- [ ] finish setting up PiCarX as described on the SharePoint @Luke
- [ ] set up programming/testing environment on the PiCarX so that we can rapidly test all features @Jacob
    - [ ] figure out software development environment (combining Python and C)
    - [ ] make PiCarX remote controllable or at least programmable (figure out the drive control interface)
    - [ ] make PiCarX able to sense data from all sensors simultaneously
    - [ ] make PiCarX able to record sensor data (ideally so that we can live stream sensor data to a laptop, perhaps at least the head camera feed)
    - [ ] set up high-level software interface between sensors and drive controls and API calls so that we can incrementally add in each new feature as it is developed
- [ ] make PiCarX able to run software on both Raspberry Pi and Coral TPU
    - [ ] figure out how to run stuff on the Coral TPU
- [ ] determine strategy for different detection of objects/patterns 
    - [ ] road signs (stop, no entry, yield, one way) @Hendrix
    - [ ] road markings (road boundary, road center line, intersection stop line, cross walk, one way arrow) @Jacob
    - [ ] road obstacles (vehicles, duck pedestrians, other objects) @Hendrix
        - [ ] take photos of specialty duck we got
- [ ] represent the map of Quackston in software that aligns with the VPFS @Hendrix
    - [ ] see website:
        - https://queensuca.sharepoint.com/teams/CCT-938446/SitePages/The-Town.aspx
        - https://queensuca.sharepoint.com/teams/CCT-938446/SitePages/GPS-and-Fare-System.aspx
- [ ] VPFS Setup @Matt
    - [ ] make PiCarX able to send API calls to VPFS and store results
    - [ ] perhaps use flask, find some other library
- [ ] setup basic vehicle controls @Jacob
    - [ ] acceleration motors
    - [ ] steering servo
- [ ] setup vehicle signaling @Luke
    - [ ] put break and turn signal lights on PiCarX
    - [ ] make break light system work
        - [ ] specify what states of the vehicle will trigger brake lights
    - [ ] make turn signal light system work
        - [ ] specify blinking rate and high-level software control interface
- [ ] miscellaneous vehicle controls @Luke
    - [ ] head camera servos
    - [ ] duck lift servos
- [ ] Test physical capabilities of drive controls
    - [ ] we could get some rubber matt to test the car on for feb 8
    - [ ] turn radius at different speeds and road surfaces (feb 11)
    - [ ] top speed on different road surfaces (feb 11)
    - [ ] minimum braking distance at different speeds and road surfaces from the point in time when braking is initiated in software
        - [ ] figure out how we are going to measure this (perhaps using the grayscale line detector?)
- [ ] break down more tasks here
    - [ ] route planning (optimal sequence of road and intersections between two destinations on the map)
    - [ ] path planning (specific path on the road to be followed by drive controls)
    - [ ] ride selection
    - [ ] position generation
    - [ ] represent the reward system / road rules in software
    - [ ] be able to infer vehicle position based on sensor data
    - [ ] be able to infer other object positions base on sensor data
    - [ ] implement autonomous driving capabilities
